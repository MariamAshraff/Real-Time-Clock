# Real-Time-Clock
🕰️ Real-Time Clock Project 🕰️

I'm excited to share a project I've been working on! This Real-Time Clock (RTC) is built using an AVR microcontroller.

🔹 Features:

-Set the time using a keypad and LCD interface .
-Displays time on seven-segments by using multiplexing.
-Error handling for invalid input.
-Displays (seconds, minutes, hours) very accurately .

🔹 Hardware:

-Atmega32.
-LCD.
-6 Seven-segments.
-Keypad.
-External crystal.

Software:
-drivers (lcd,keypad,seven segment,timer,DIO).
-Main app.
